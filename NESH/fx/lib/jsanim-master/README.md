I wrote this back in 2010, when I was a Sophomore in Undergrad. I have not used it or updated it since then. I was an okay programmer back then, but I've learned a lot since then so no guarantees on quality here. I'm dumping this here because I was moving a bunch of old code from my old blog and figured I'd hit this too.

This library became surprisingly popular, especially amongst Spanish-speaking web developers, for some reason I've never been aware. The popularity is probably due to the [website intro](http://www.jsanim.com). The quality of that animation is not really due to the magic of this library, but just a little dumb cleverness that can be done using any animation library.

I highly recommend you do not use this library as-is. Components may be embeddable, but it's slow, large, clumbsy and probably not cross-browser compatible. Original documentation here at [the website](http://www.jsanim.com).

Instead of this library, I'd recommend just using [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). Their animation support is generally faster, more compliant, and covers all the use-cases that are actually worth implementing.

On the other hand, if you'd like to improve this, I'll make you a collaborator.
